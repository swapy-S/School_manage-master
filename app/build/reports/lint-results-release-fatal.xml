        summary="Registered class is not instantiatable"
        explanation="Activities, services, broadcast receivers etc. registered in the manifest file (or for custom views, in a layout file) must be &quot;instantiatable&quot; by the system, which means that the class must be public, it must have an empty public constructor, and if it&apos;s an inner class, it must be a static inner class."
